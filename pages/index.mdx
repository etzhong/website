# Eric Zhong

Hey There! 

I'm Eric and I'm a junior at USC studying towards a bachelors and masters in Computer Engineering.
I'm passionate about all things computers; particularly computer architecture, low-level systems, and high-performance computing.
Here you'll find some of my work plus some random bits and pieces from my life. 

Thanks for stopping by! :D

This site is a work in progress so I'm still building things out bit by bit.
